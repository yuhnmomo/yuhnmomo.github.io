Subject: A powerful young emperor named Lu Boyan, with sharp sword-like eyebrows and deep star-like eyes, wearing an elaborate black-gold imperial robe; his presence radiates dominance and burning desire. Action/Pose/State: Standing in the wind with one hand lifting the edge of his robe as if just turned from the palace hall; eyes narrowed in a cold, commanding gaze; lips slightly pursed, exuding authority and restrained lust. Environment/Background: Ancient imperial garden at night, with falling red plum blossoms, golden palace lanterns flickering, stone steps beside a water channel, and distant red walls and golden roofs of the deep palace. Art Style: Japanese semi-realistic anime style, with delicate facial rendering and refined light-shadow detailing; ornate clothing design with rich embroidery and symbolic motifs. Lighting and Color: Primary lighting from above-right cold white moonlight casting strong shadows on neck and jaw; secondary warm lighting from candles and lanterns reflecting gold on his robe; color palette of deep ink black, crimson, and imperial gold, creating a contrast between fire and shadow. Composition/Perspective: Three-quarter composition, character placed on the right two-thirds of the canvas; low angle perspective to emphasize dominance and divine aura; background fades softly for depth of field, spotlighting the characterâ€™s presence. Details and Quality: Ultra-detailed, 8K resolution, intricate golden embroidery on the robe with visible thread texture; wide sleeves with dragon insignia, jade ornament at the waist; high topknot hairstyle with flowing strands of hair caught in breeze; eyes glowing with restrained flame, imperial aura illustrated through subtle red particle effects; skin tone cool and smooth
