A mysterious and elegant male figure with long flowing silver-white hair, wearing a dark indigo Taoist robe embroidered with intricate silver celestial patterns. He stands solemnly on an ancient astrological platform under a starry night sky, bathed in soft moonlight. His expression is calm and distant, his silver eyes reflecting the glow of the stars. In his left hand, he gently holds a jade flute, while his right fingers trace glowing constellations in the air. The floor beneath him is a glowing ancient star map etched with arcane runes and astrological symbols. Background features swirling galaxies, full moon, and ornate celestial architecture. Highly detailed, anime semi-realistic style, ultra-high resolution, dramatic lighting, ethereal and dreamlike mood, elegant composition with a slight low-angle perspective
